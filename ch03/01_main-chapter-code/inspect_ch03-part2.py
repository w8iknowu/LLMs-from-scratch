"""
My code for inspection coressponding to ch03.
It's focusing on chapter 3.4, self-attention with trainable weights implementation.
Some matrix operation in original file is implemented with for-loop, easier to understand, but less effective, which is good for learning.
Here mine is implemented with a more vecotrization way, this is faster in speed, but may make it harder to understand.
